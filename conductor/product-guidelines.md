# Product Guidelines - clio
\n\n## Content & Tone\n- **Objective & Concise:** All generated metadata, summaries, and logs must be objective and data-focused. Avoid unnecessary narrative or fluff; prioritize clarity and information density.\n\n## Visual Identity & UX\n- **Minimalist & Functional:** The user interface must prioritize speed and data density. Focus on utility over decorative elements.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure high readability and compatibility with simple text-based viewing.\n\n## Privacy & Security\n- **Zero-Telemetry Policy:** Under no circumstances should any data (conversations, memories, or usage metrics) be transmitted outside the local machine. This is a hard requirement for privacy.\n- **Local-First Architecture:** All processing and storage must occur on the user's local filesystem.\n\n## Data Integrity & Structure\n- **Immutable History:** To preserve a reliable archive, existing entries in `conversations.json` and `memories.json` should be treated as immutable. Only append-only operations are permitted for historical records.\n- **Hybrid Optimization:** Data structures must be optimized for two primary use cases:\n    1. **Plaintext Readability:** Easily accessible and understandable via standard text editors.\n    2. **Machine-Learning Ready:** Structured and tagged to facilitate efficient ingestion and processing by Large Language Models (LLMs).
