# Initial Concept

I'd like to create a simple interface for being able to search through conversations.json

# Product Definition - ClaudeJSON

## Vision & Purpose
ClaudeJSON serves as a personal, high-privacy structured data repository. Its core purpose is to act as a "second brain" for the user, archiving AI interaction history, personal memories, and project-specific documentation in a machine-readable format.

## Target Audience
The primary user is the individual owner of the data (Adam Goehrig-Bawany), who requires a centralized and private way to track personal history, health metrics, and business-related AI interactions.

## Core Goals
- **Permanent Archiving:** Maintain a complete and searchable history of AI conversations to prevent information loss across different platforms.
- **Efficient Retrieval:** Enable the user to quickly find specific past decisions, information, or insights from their historical data.
- **Privacy & Control:** Keep all sensitive personal and business data strictly local to the user's environment.

## Key Features (Prioritized)
- **Advanced Search & Browsing:** Modern web interface for browsing the entire archive with deep keyword search, contextual navigation, and date filtering. Includes global archive statistics and auto-expanded matches.
- **Data Consolidation:** A single source of truth for diverse data types (conversations, health, business context).
- **Metadata Management:** Structured storage of interaction summaries, UUIDs, and timestamps for every entry.

## Success Criteria
- The user can retrieve any specific conversation or memory within seconds.
- The data remains fully contained within the local filesystem.
