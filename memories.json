He's also preparing for the arrival of his first child, having recently developed comprehensive parenting strategies focused on newborn care, sleep management, and supporting his wife during recovery and breastfeeding.\n\n**Brief history**\n\n*Recent months*\n\nAdam has been considering adjusting his Lexapro dosage from 10mg to potentially 15mg or 20mg based on his psychiatrist's recommendation, researching the clinical evidence and side effect profiles while timing this decision around his upcoming major life transition. He filed taxes for the first time as a self-employed individual with 1099 income, choosing to file separately from his spouse to keep business finances distinct, and learned about quarterly estimated payments and business expense deductions. His startup Ode required filing Delaware franchise tax and federal Form 1120 despite having no revenue, with important March deadlines for state compliance.\n\n*Earlier context*\n\nAdam engaged deeply with complex science fiction concepts, particularly Liu Cixin's Three-Body trilogy, demonstrating strong interest in the series' higher-dimensional physics, cosmic sociology theories, and philosophical implications spanning the entire narrative arc. He conducted comprehensive cardiac health assessments using his health data, receiving grades in the B+/A- range but noting concerning year-over-year trends including a 10% increase in resting heart rate. He also explored entertainment recommendations, seeking cozy winter films and developing prompts for Google NotebookLM's audio overview feature to analyze entire books.", "account_uuid": "99b62b86-f9d9-4258-b7d1-2953edacd40d"}]
